# Typical monit configuration for monitoring different services

[По-русски / In Russian](README.ru.md)

Here is the typical configuration [monit](https://mmonit.com/monit/) for monitoring different services for Debian-like distributions.

There is also a bash-script "monit-upgrade.sh" for updating [monit](https://mmonit.com/monit/) to the latest stable version in Debian-like distributions.
